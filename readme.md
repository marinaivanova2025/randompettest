This resource creates a random pet name: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/random/3.7.2

It provides resources that generate random values during their creation and then hold those values steady until the inputs are changed.

It is very useful when you want to generate names or tags to numerous resources without having to think of names and hard-coding them.
